# nmaipy
Nearmap AI python (nmaipy - pronounced "en-my-pie") is a collection of tools to allow a user to extract data from Nearmap AI products using public APIs. It covers a range of uses, from smaller scale exports, to national data sets for research of hundreds of millions of buildings. It includes a section of user guides as Jupyter notebooks to help users get started with using Nearmap AI APIs, and some guides to help with common analytical tasks on top of the data.

## Running an Export

Using a command line interface, navigate to the project root directory. `run.sh` includes a basic example to export data from a set of AOIs using the AI Feature API.
